I am currently pursuing my Master of Science in Business Analytics at Hult International Business School, where I am applying my skills in data analysis and visualization to solve real-world problems. I am passionate about using data-driven insights to drive business growth and innovation.

As a Business Analytics Specialist, I leverage my analytical skills and process improvement expertise to enhance operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. I have a strong background in transaction banking, having worked as a Transaction Banking products and servicesâ€™ process improvement specialist at Khan Bank for over two years. There, I led initiatives to improve international and domestic transaction system processes, developed business requirement documents, and conducted user acceptance testing. 

I am particularly interested in data science, business analysis, and technical project management, with a focus on the tech and fintech industries. My core competencies, including collaborative teamwork, creative problem-solving, and adaptability, drive my commitment to continuous growth and learning. I am passionate about mastering business concepts and immersing myself in various cultures. Thanks to my background studying in a diverse environment, I am able to navigate different perspectives and foster strong connections.
